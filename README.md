# Zone01 Oujda Profile Page

A personal profile web application built to explore and learn **GraphQL**, **JWT authentication**, and **SVG-based data visualization** using the Zone01 Oujda learning platform API.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic profile page by querying personalized user data from the Zone01 Oujda GraphQL API. It includes:

- A **Login Page** that authenticates users using JWT obtained via the platform's signin endpoint.
- A **Profile Page** displaying key user data such as identification info, XP earned, grades, audits, and skills.
- An interactive **Statistics Section** featuring at least two types of graphs rendered with **SVG** to visualize progress and achievements.
- Secure **JWT token management** to access the GraphQL API with Bearer authentication.
- Responsive and user-friendly **UI/UX** design principles.

## Features

- **Login / Logout** system supporting both username:password and email:password authentication.
- GraphQL queries with **normal**, **nested**, and **argument-based** queries to retrieve user-specific data.
